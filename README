 See file COPYING for details.
 
What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~
i8086emu is an multi-platform emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor. 
It has support for dynamically loadable device plugins and some peripherals like a 
PIT, PIC, 8-segment-displays, buttons and leds. i8086emu comes with an ncurses and 
an GTK-2 gui. i8086emu should run on most linux distributions and cygwin environments.

Feel free to report bugs, feature requests or comments to perrin_@users.sourceforge.net

installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

$ cd i8086emu_lnx
$ ./configure
$ cd src

  [Optional] GUI
  $ cd src
  $ make i8086gui


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * GTK+ 2.0 or higher (this is available at http://www.gtk.org).
 * gcc 2.95 or higher
 * nasm or other assembler for compiling asm-source files (available at http://nasm.sourceforge.net)
 * for using the i8086beep.so (plugin for accessing the pc-speaker via asm) a suid'ed beep is necessary (http://www.johnath.com/beep)
 * for compiling this source under Win32 a cygwin installation is required - or just use our win32 binary package :o)
 
Release Notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* on some misconfigured systems the antialiasing-feature of GTK makes some trouble ... for fixing this change the USEXFT option in
  the ~/.emu.cfg
* up-to-date information about this release can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/i8086emu/
* only plain 16bit-binarys (commonly known as COM files, no ELF or EXE) are supported

Autoloading Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* i8086emu autoloads plugin librarys if they are specified in ~/.emu.cfg. Remember incrementing the DEVICECOUNT option
  when adding a plugin.
  
Ncurses text-version of i8086emu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* for using the text version comment in the ROM-lines in ~/.emu.cfg and comment out the core.dmp - line
* use i8086text for running the text-version of our emulator with the following command line parameters:

i8086text [Options] filename
 -c 		-> disables the disassembler - window
 -oXXXXh 	-> startaddress where filename is loaded to in the i8086 memory
 -r XXXXh file 	-> when loading a rom file this specifies the CodeSegment value
 -d file 	-> load memory dumpfile
 --version 	-> print version information
 --help		-> print help information
 
 Shortcuts while running the emu:
 
 q       -         quit emulator
 r       -         change content of registers
 w       -         change content of memory
 m       -         change startaddress of displayed memory
 F1      -         some help
 F2      -         set a breakpointaddress
 F3      -         make coredump of current memory
 F7      -         trace/single step
 F8      -         next/step over
 F9      -         run loaded program (until breakpoint or until end)
 F12     -         CPU reset - jump to rom routines
 0-7     -         switch the buttons
 a-f	 -	   press keyboard keys (note - keyboard is hidden ;op)
 
GTK2 gui-version of i8086emu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* use i8086gui for running the gui-version of our emulator 

 here is a list of shortcuts:
 
 CTRL + O	-	Open file
 CTRL + Q	-	Quit
 CTRL + M	-	change memory content
 CTRL + R	-	change registers
 CTRL + B	-	set breakpoints
 ALT + 0-9	-	keys of the keyboard unit
 ALT + a-f	-	keys of the keyboard unit
 F7		-	trace/single step
 F8		-	next/step over
 F9		-	run
 ESC		-	stop
 
 
Config file
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * well I think if you downloaded this piece of goodness you will find the emu.cfg self-explaining ;op
 * hint: never use core.dmp and rom at the same time

HOWTO write plugins for i8086emu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * currently the plugin API consists of only a few functions - may be this API will grow in the future
 * the concept of this API is to register MSG-Handler functions to some events
 * first function which has to be implemented in every plugin:
 
 void DeviceInit(i8086DeviceCalls *calls)
 -	this function is called when the plugin is loaded and should init the MsgHandler functions
 
 * a MsgHandler function should have the following prototype:
 
 void MsgHandler(unsigned short msg, unsigned int hParam, unsigned int lParam)
    - msg could be one of the constants, defined in i8086messages.h
 
 * there are 2 more optional functions which we recommend you to implement
 
    void DeviceReset() - this function is called everytime the CPU-Reset button is hit and should bring 
    your device in a state of harmony or any kind of standard state;op
    
    void DeviceClose() - is called if the emu is closed and should free all used ressources
    
 * for examples on how to write a plugin please look in src/devices - think you will figure it out more easily by taking
   a look at our sources
   
 * hint: the plugins have to be linked against i8086error.o i8086messages.o and i8086util.o so far
 
 
Additions
~~~~~~~~~

The dissambler code (src/disasm) was actually taken from NASM 0.98.38 (http://nasm.sourceforge.net)
Thanks to the NASM team :)
